Crystal:
I don’t think we have time for another encounter, Damien.
1
Crystal:
How about we just take a rest and pick up here next time?
2
Damien:
I guess I lost track of time. Do you guys need to go?
3
Teddy:
I have time. My dad said he might be late anyways.
4
Damien:
What about you, Hunter?
5
Hunter:
I’m riding with Teddy, remember? I’m game.
6
Crystal:
Ok, but we should still take a rest and recover health.
7
Teddy:
For real. This campaign is too hard, D.
8
Damien:
No it’s not. I’ve just been getting a lot of lucky ro-
9
Damien:
-Oh wait!
10
Hunter:
… for what?
11
Damien:
There it is... Nice.
12
Damien:
I just picked up a new d20, and I almost forgot about it. It’s so much cooler looking than my old one.
13
Teddy:
Woah. That is cool.
14
Crystal:
When did you get that? We’re together like all the time.
15
Damien:
We’re twins, Crystal, not BFFs. I have a life. Anyways, you know the new kid? I traded her for it.
16
Hunter:
What did you trade?
17
Damien:
Well… nothing, exactly. She just said that maybe I could help her with her own campaign later.
18
Crystal:
I have no idea who you’re talking about, but I can’t believe you didn’t tell me that there’s another girl at our school playing D&D.
19
Crystal:
Ugh! I wish we weren’t knee-deep in this campaign so I could dump you fools and join her game.
20
Hunter:
Ouch.
21
Damien:
Yeah, ouch.
22
Teddy:
Ugh! We’re running out of time. Let’s play!
23
Damien:
Ok. So when we left our heroes, you’d split up to scout the woods to make sure you were safe.
24
Damien:
I’m going to roll this d20 to see if anything mischievous might be happening in the woods while you’re resting.
